Can we recognize input?

Binary component:  11 hex values
Decimal component:  4 decimal values
Reid:  Starts with one of UFRDBL
Stickers:  54 values, max is 5
Heykube:  54 values, max is 53

So we only need to specify output formats.  We can specify as many
as we want.

-b binary
-c component
-R reid
-s stickers
-h heykube
